                        1 in 500 translates to 0.2%, which supports the statement. However, the statement could be conflicting with the suggestion that HCM might be more common than previously estimated.

                        Genes on five loci on separate chromosomes are responsible for a familial disease in which all or part of the ventricular muscle undergoes thickening with a histological picture of irregular hypertrophy and disorganized arrangement of myocytes (disarray). The three genes identified so far encode for beta heavy chain myosin (chromosome 14), troponin T (chromosome 1) and alpha tropomyosin (chromosome 15).

                        Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex cardiovascular disorder particularly sensitive to environmental changes and physiologic stress. Warm weather and strenuous activity can be a dangerous combination for people that have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Often sudden cardiac death is the first symptom of the disorder.

                        beta-Adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are the first-line therapy for HCM. However, beta-blockers commonly selected for this disease are often poorly tolerated in patients, where heart-rate reduction and noncardiac effects can lead to reduced cardiac output and fatigue.

A systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve (SAM) was observed in obstructive cases only and characterized by a large backward component in late systole and an extreme approximation to the interventricular septum at its peak.

                        Electrocardiogram typically shows repolarization changes and giant (>10 mm), inverted T waves in the anterolateral leads.

                        Attention is drawn to the finding that in many differing etiologies of left ventricular hypertrophy ST-T-wave changes commonly referred to as 'strain'-pattern are a harbinger of an increased risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.

                        ECG changes such as ST-T wave abnormalities are relevant for diagnosing LVH in the context of HCM.
