                        Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn's disease, including a dysregulated immune system... The uncontrolled activation of the immune system toward antigens contained in the gut lumen in genetically predisposed subjects is believed to be the leading cause of inflammatory bowel disease.

                        Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. CD is multifactorial, involving the complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors... we mapped markers of disease-associated myofibroblast activation and identified CHMP1A, TBX3, and RNF168 as regulators of fibrotic complications.

                        Crohn's disease (CD) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by transmural inflammation along the alimentary tract. Changes in the microbial composition and reduction in species diversity are recognized as pivotal hallmarks in disease dynamics, challenging the gut barrier function and shaping a pathological immune response in genetically influenced subjects.

                        The pathogenesis of both disease phenotypes is complex, the likely primary defect lies in the innate rather than adaptive immunity, particularly in the chemical antimicrobial barrier of the mucosa. This ileal and colonic defect in innate defense mediated by a deficiency of the protective alpha- and beta-defensins may enable the luminal microbes to invade the mucosa and trigger the inflammation.

                        Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are both inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota.

Unfortunately, surgery does not cure CD, and, regardless of the extent of bowel removed, recurrence may be seen in the small bowel.
