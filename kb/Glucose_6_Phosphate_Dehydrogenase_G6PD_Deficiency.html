                        exposure to certain food, drugs, or infections can trigger acute hemolytic anemia.

                        The literature clearly states that food, drugs, and infections can act as triggers for hemolytic anemia in individuals with G6PD deficiency.

                        This reference supports the statement by indicating that various environmental factors, including drugs and foods, can trigger hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals.

                        Five cases of hemolytic episodes arising from the loading of trinitrotoluene (TNT) were detected. All five workers showed absolute G6PD deficiency.

                        The incidence of hemolytic episodes in the context of TNT exposure further supports that environmental factors can trigger hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals.
