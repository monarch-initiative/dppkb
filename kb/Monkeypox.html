                        The disease is known to cause severe outcome in children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised hosts and this group need to be given special attention. The monkeypox disease outbreak (2022) in non-endemic countries should be used as an opportunity by India and other low and middle income countries to strengthen public health surveillance and health system capacity for outbreak and epidemic preparedness and response.

                        The reference suggests that while the 2022 outbreak occurred in non-endemic countries, monkeypox remains endemic in Central and West Africa, supporting the statement about varying prevalence by outbreak and its endemic status in these regions.

                        Initially, there is a prodrome phase of a few days, which is followed by the appearance of rashes. The dermatological manifestations are in the form of an exanthematous rash, which transforms through a macular, papular, and vesicular phase and disappears after crusting in approximately 3 weeks.
