                        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensibility, delayed wound healing, joint hypermobility, thin skin, easy bruising, tissue fragility, 'cigarette-paper' scarring over bony prominences, mitral valve prolapse, and other findings.
