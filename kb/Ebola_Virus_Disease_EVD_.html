                        Our results suggest a serologic prevalence of 2%-3.5% in the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have reported outbreaks of infection with EBOV. In addition we detected a seroprevalence of 1.3% in southern Cameroon, which indicated a low risk for exposure in this region.

                        Ebolavirus disease (EVD) continues to pose a serious threat to global health. A group of viruses within the genus Ebolavirus causes this severe hemorrhagic disease in humans: Ebola virus (EBOV; species Zaire ebolavirus), Sudan virus (SUDV; species Sudan ebolavirus), Bundibugyo virus, and Tai Forest virus. EBOV and SUDV are associated with the highest case fatality rates.

EVD has a high case-fatality rate; it is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal signs and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
