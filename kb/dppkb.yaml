        snippet: 'We observed two neurophysiologic findings in JS: (1) focal interictal EDs from posterior head region; and (2) predominant focal posterior ictal EDs preceding generalized EDs.'
        explanation: While the study supports an increased excitability of neurons in response to visual stimuli (such as photic stimulation), it does not specifically identify excitatory glutamatergic neurons as the key cell type involved.
      - reference: PMID:31444362
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied by a strong alteration in glia-neuron interactions and a massive increase in extracellular glutamate.

  - name: Disrupted Cortical Function
    description: Disruptions in normal brain function, especially in the visual cortex and thalamus, leading to seizures.
    locations:
      - Visual Cortex
      - Thalamus
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:21729035
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: JS has been proposed as idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) because of normal posterior dominant background activity and paroxysmal generalized ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs). However, we noticed subtle occipital EDs preceding EM and interictal posterior EDs using digital video-EEG... Further clinical observations of seizures induced by eye closure, photic stimulation, and hyperventilation along with EEG paroxysms would raise the possibility of the occipital cortex initiating generalized epilepsy network involving the brainstem, and thalamocortical and transcortical pathways in JS.
        explanation: The literature indicates involvement of the occipital cortex and mentions generalized epilepsy networks, which may include the thalamus. However, it does not explicitly support the claim that disruptions in the visual cortex and thalamus are the predominant mechanisms in Jeavons Syndrome.
      - reference: PMID:29880477
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: Largely accepted in the literature is the role the interconnections between the thalamus and cortex play in generalized epilepsy. However, thalamocortical involvement is less understood in focal epilepsy in terms of the effect of seizures on thalamocortical circuitry in the developing brain and subsequent cognitive outcome.
        explanation: This study discusses the role of thalamocortical connections in generalized and focal epilepsy but does not provide specific information on Jeavons Syndrome or its mechanisms.

        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: All participants completed neuropsychological evaluations. Statistical analyses revealed performance that was below average on measures of global IQ, processing speed and rote, verbal learning coupled with average nonverbal reasoning, and sustained attention. There was also evidence of impaired higher-level verbal reasoning. While global IQ ranged from low average to borderline impaired, no participant could be accurately described as impaired or having intellectual disability (ID) given the consistently average performance noted on some higher-order tasks including nonverbal reasoning.
        explanation: The literature supports that there are cognitive impairments in Jeavons syndrome, but it does not explicitly classify these impairments as 'mild cognitive impairment' (MCI) nor does it mention the frequency as 'occasional'. The impairments are more specific and varied, making the statement partially correct but not completely accurate.

    notes: Confirms TB diagnosis.
treatments:
  - name: Isoniazid
    description: First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.
    notes: It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
    mechanism:
      - name: Prodrug Activation
        description: Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.
      - name: Inhibition of InhA
        description: The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids.
      - name: Depletion of mycolic acids
        description: By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria resist the host's immune response.
      - name: Cell wall disruption
        description: The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the host's immune defenses and other antibiotics.
      - name: Reactive oxygen species
        description: In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.
      - name: Bactericidal action
        description: The combination of cell wall disruption and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ultimately leads to the death of the M. tuberculosis bacteria.
  - name: Rifampicin
    description: Bactericidal antibiotic used for TB treatment.
    notes: Rifampicin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is particularly effective against mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis, as it can easily penetrate the lipid-rich cell wall.
    mechanism:
      - name: Inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase
        description: Rifampicin binds to the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing the initiation of RNA synthesis.
      - name: Disruption of bacterial transcription
        description: By inhibiting RNA polymerase, rifampicin disrupts bacterial transcription, which is essential for protein synthesis and bacterial survival.
  - name: Ethambutol
    description: Bacteriostatic antibiotic used for TB treatment.
    notes: Ethambutol is specific to mycobacteria and is often used in combination with other antitubercular drugs to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
    mechanism:
      - name: Inhibition of arabinogalactan synthesis
        description: Ethambutol interferes with the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, a key component of the mycobacterial cell wall.
      - name: Inhibition of arabinosyl transferase
        description: Ethambutol inhibits the enzyme arabinosyl transferase, which is responsible for the polymerization of arabinose into arabinan, a precursor of arabinogalactan.
      - name: Compromised cell wall integrity
        description: By disrupting the synthesis of arabinogalactan, ethambutol compromises the integrity of the cell wall, making the bacteria more susceptible to host defenses and other antibiotics.
  - name: Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
    description: Health worker observes and records patients taking their medication to ensure adherence.
  - name: Latent TB Treatment
    description: Isoniazid or rifapentine used to prevent latent TB from becoming active.
notes: TB is a significant global health issue, particularly in low-income and developing countries.
