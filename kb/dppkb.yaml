review_notes: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis (both venous and arterial) and pregnancy complications due to autoantibodies against phospholipid-binding proteins. I expanded the thrombosis phenotypes to include both venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) and arterial thrombosis (stroke/MI). I also added additional occasional phenotypes seen in APS like preeclampsia, livedo reticularis skin changes, and migraines. The pregnancy complications are a key feature so I increased their frequency to frequent.

review_notes: Vitiligo is an acquired disorder of skin pigmentation characterized by the development of white patches due to loss of melanocytes. While the depigmented patches and premature hair whitening are the defining features, it's important to highlight the frequent association with other autoimmune conditions. The psychosocial impact of the condition should also not be overlooked. I've adjusted some frequencies based on typical clinical presentation and added a few additional associated findings for completeness.

        snippet: 'The clinical presentation in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) reflects the distribution of the pathologic changes rather than the exact histologic subtype of the disease. Three major clinical syndromes can be identified: 1) frontal variant FTD (dementia of frontal type) in which changes in social behavior and personality predominate, reflecting the orbitobasal frontal lobe focus of the pathology. Traditional cognitive tests are insensitive, but more specific measures are under development; 2) semantic dementia (progressive fluent aphasia) in which there is a breakdown in the conceptual database which underlies language production and comprehension, although deficits in nonverbal semantic knowledge can also be shown on neuropsychologic testing. Patients with semantic dementia have asymmetric anterolateral temporal atrophy with relative sparing of the hippocampal formation, which is typically worse on the left side. A variant of this syndrome affecting the right temporal lobe presents with progressive prosopagnosia; 3) progressive nonfluent aphasia in which the phonologic and syntactic components of language are affected in association with left peri-Sylvian atrophy. The assessment of patients with potential FTD involves a multidisciplinary approach. The development of comprehensive caregiver-based neuropsychiatric instruments, neuropsychologic tasks sensitive to semantic memory and other key cognitive impairments, and functional (hexamethyly-propyleneamine-SPECT) and structural (MRI) brain imaging represent significant advances in the field.'

        snippet: 'We observed two neurophysiologic findings in JS: (1) focal interictal EDs from posterior head region; and (2) predominant focal posterior ictal EDs preceding generalized EDs.'
        explanation: While the study supports an increased excitability of neurons in response to visual stimuli (such as photic stimulation), it does not specifically identify excitatory glutamatergic neurons as the key cell type involved.
      - reference: PMID:31444362
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied by a strong alteration in glia-neuron interactions and a massive increase in extracellular glutamate.
        explanation: This study discusses neural activity and connectivity alterations and increased extracellular glutamate during seizures but does not specifically associate these findings with Jeavons Syndrome.
  - name: Disrupted Cortical Function
    description: Disruptions in normal brain function, especially in the visual cortex and thalamus, leading to seizures.
    locations:
      - Visual Cortex
      - Thalamus
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:21729035
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: JS has been proposed as idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) because of normal posterior dominant background activity and paroxysmal generalized ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs). However, we noticed subtle occipital EDs preceding EM and interictal posterior EDs using digital video-EEG... Further clinical observations of seizures induced by eye closure, photic stimulation, and hyperventilation along with EEG paroxysms would raise the possibility of the occipital cortex initiating generalized epilepsy network involving the brainstem, and thalamocortical and transcortical pathways in JS.
        explanation: The literature indicates involvement of the occipital cortex and mentions generalized epilepsy networks, which may include the thalamus. However, it does not explicitly support the claim that disruptions in the visual cortex and thalamus are the predominant mechanisms in Jeavons Syndrome.
      - reference: PMID:29880477
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: Largely accepted in the literature is the role the interconnections between the thalamus and cortex play in generalized epilepsy. However, thalamocortical involvement is less understood in focal epilepsy in terms of the effect of seizures on thalamocortical circuitry in the developing brain and subsequent cognitive outcome.
        explanation: This study discusses the role of thalamocortical connections in generalized and focal epilepsy but does not provide specific information on Jeavons Syndrome or its mechanisms.

    frequency: OCCASIONAL
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:26492104
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: All participants completed neuropsychological evaluations. Statistical analyses revealed performance that was below average on measures of global IQ, processing speed and rote, verbal learning coupled with average nonverbal reasoning, and sustained attention. There was also evidence of impaired higher-level verbal reasoning. While global IQ ranged from low average to borderline impaired, no participant could be accurately described as impaired or having intellectual disability (ID) given the consistently average performance noted on some higher-order tasks including nonverbal reasoning.
        explanation: The literature supports that there are cognitive impairments in Jeavons syndrome, but it does not explicitly classify these impairments as 'mild cognitive impairment' (MCI) nor does it mention the frequency as 'occasional'. The impairments are more specific and varied, making the statement partially correct but not completely accurate.

treatments:
  - name: Isoniazid
    description: First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.
    notes: It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
    mechanism:
      - name: Prodrug Activation
        description: Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.
      - name: Inhibition of InhA
        description: The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids.
      - name: Depletion of mycolic acids
        description: By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria resist the host's immune response.
      - name: Cell wall disruption
        description: The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the host's immune defenses and other antibiotics.
      - name: Reactive oxygen species
        description: In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.
      - name: Bactericidal action

        snippet: Malignant melanoma represents a neoplasm stemming from melanocytes or the cells that develop from melanocytes. Melanocytes, pigment-producing cells, arise from the neural crest and migrate to their final destinations in the skin, uveal tract, meninges, and mucosa. Most melanocytes are found at the epidermal-dermal junction of the skin, and the vast majority of melanocytes arise from cutaneous sites. Cancerous growths develop when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanning beds) triggers mutations (genetic defects) that lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumours.
        explanation: While chemotherapy is an established approach for treating malignant melanoma, this reference does not provide explicit information about its use specifically in congenital melanocytic nevus-related melanoma.

review_notes: Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can cause rapid and severe dehydration that can be lethal. Additional key features include "rice-water" diarrhea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis due to the massive fluid losses. Hypovolemic shock is the most severe complication. Rapid fluid and electrolyte replacement is critical.
