review_notes: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis (both venous and arterial) and pregnancy complications due to autoantibodies against phospholipid-binding proteins. I expanded the thrombosis phenotypes to include both venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) and arterial thrombosis (stroke/MI). I also added additional occasional phenotypes seen in APS like preeclampsia, livedo reticularis skin changes, and migraines. The pregnancy complications are a key feature so I increased their frequency to frequent.

        snippet: 'We observed two neurophysiologic findings in JS: (1) focal interictal EDs from posterior head region; and (2) predominant focal posterior ictal EDs preceding generalized EDs.'
        explanation: While the study supports an increased excitability of neurons in response to visual stimuli (such as photic stimulation), it does not specifically identify excitatory glutamatergic neurons as the key cell type involved.
      - reference: PMID:31444362
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: The transition from a preictal state to a generalized seizure leads to an abrupt increase in neural activity and connectivity, which is accompanied by a strong alteration in glia-neuron interactions and a massive increase in extracellular glutamate.
        explanation: This study discusses neural activity and connectivity alterations and increased extracellular glutamate during seizures but does not specifically associate these findings with Jeavons Syndrome.
  - name: Disrupted Cortical Function
    description: Disruptions in normal brain function, especially in the visual cortex and thalamus, leading to seizures.
    locations:
      - Visual Cortex
      - Thalamus
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:21729035
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: JS has been proposed as idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) because of normal posterior dominant background activity and paroxysmal generalized ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs). However, we noticed subtle occipital EDs preceding EM and interictal posterior EDs using digital video-EEG... Further clinical observations of seizures induced by eye closure, photic stimulation, and hyperventilation along with EEG paroxysms would raise the possibility of the occipital cortex initiating generalized epilepsy network involving the brainstem, and thalamocortical and transcortical pathways in JS.
        explanation: The literature indicates involvement of the occipital cortex and mentions generalized epilepsy networks, which may include the thalamus. However, it does not explicitly support the claim that disruptions in the visual cortex and thalamus are the predominant mechanisms in Jeavons Syndrome.
      - reference: PMID:29880477
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: Largely accepted in the literature is the role the interconnections between the thalamus and cortex play in generalized epilepsy. However, thalamocortical involvement is less understood in focal epilepsy in terms of the effect of seizures on thalamocortical circuitry in the developing brain and subsequent cognitive outcome.
        explanation: This study discusses the role of thalamocortical connections in generalized and focal epilepsy but does not provide specific information on Jeavons Syndrome or its mechanisms.

    name: Mild Cognitive Impairment
    frequency: OCCASIONAL
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:26492104
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: All participants completed neuropsychological evaluations. Statistical analyses revealed performance that was below average on measures of global IQ, processing speed and rote, verbal learning coupled with average nonverbal reasoning, and sustained attention. There was also evidence of impaired higher-level verbal reasoning. While global IQ ranged from low average to borderline impaired, no participant could be accurately described as impaired or having intellectual disability (ID) given the consistently average performance noted on some higher-order tasks including nonverbal reasoning.
        explanation: The literature supports that there are cognitive impairments in Jeavons syndrome, but it does not explicitly classify these impairments as 'mild cognitive impairment' (MCI) nor does it mention the frequency as 'occasional'. The impairments are more specific and varied, making the statement partially correct but not completely accurate.
  - category: Neurologic
    frequency: FREQUENT

      - reference: PMID:37377591
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: In CD, the ileum is frequently affected and about one third of patients presents with a pure ileal type.
        explanation: This reference supports the statement that Crohn's disease involves inflammation of the ileum, and specifies this subtype as Ileal Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:30882291
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Gastroscopy revealed severe aphthous pangastritis with biopsies showing a focal active and chronic gastritis with presence of granulomas... coloscopy showing an aphthous terminal ileum... concordant with a slightly active, mildly chronic terminal ileitis typical for Crohn's disease.
        explanation: This reference supports the claim that Crohn's disease can involve the ileum, characterizing it distinctly as terminal ileitis which is a known feature of Ileal Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:31960900
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Crohn''s disease patients with unequivocal imaging findings of ileal inflammation at enterography despite negative ileoscopy and biopsy are likely to have active inflammatory Crohn''s disease.
        explanation: This reference highlights that Crohn's disease can manifest as inflammation of the ileum, aligning with the subtype of Ileal Crohn's Disease.
  - name: Colonic Crohn's Disease
    description: Affects the colon (large intestine) with skip lesions.

      - reference: PMID:38437854
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Commonly affecting the terminal ileum and proximal colon, Crohn's disease inflammation is often discontinuous and patchy, segmental, and transmural.
        explanation: The literature indicates that Crohn's disease can affect the colon and often presents with discontinuous, patchy inflammation. However, it is typically not limited to the colon and often involves the terminal ileum.
      - reference: PMID:11271896
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The site of involvement was the ileum in three patients, the colon in one patient and both the ileum and the colon in one patient. Typical small intestinal CD occurred in four of seven patients with marked aphthous lesions of the small intestine, whereas colonic CD occurred in two of eight patients with such aphthous lesions of the colon.
        explanation: This study shows that Crohn's disease can indeed affect the colon specifically, supporting the subtype known as Colonic Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:26906301
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Although ileitis can be seen in HSP, terminal ileitis is virtually pathognomonic for Crohn disease.
        explanation: "The focus is on terminal ileitis, commonly seen in Crohn’s disease. It suggests that Crohn's disease frequently involves the ileum, but does not refute that the colon can also be involved."

        explanation: Findings indicate that Crohn's Disease can have varying and discontinuous involvement, including potentially just the colon, thereby supporting the subtype.
  - name: Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease
    description: Involves both the small intestine (ileum) and the colon.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:33712743
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract; however, current European and national guidelines worldwide do not differentiate between small-intestinal and colonic Crohn's disease for medical treatment.
        explanation: Although the literature acknowledges different manifestations of Crohn's disease involving the ileum and colon, it primarily discusses the broader differentiation between small-intestinal and colonic Crohn's Disease without naming or detailing specific subtypes such as Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:11271896
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: The site of involvement was the ileum in three patients, the colon in one patient and both the ileum and the colon in one patient.
        explanation: This provides clinical evidence of Crohn's Disease affecting both the ileum and colon in patients but does not explicitly label it as Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:38294885
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The terminal ileum and small bowel (SB) are involved in 30-45% of patients with Crohn's disease, while 20% have both small and large bowel involvement.
        explanation: This literature reference supports the statement by noting that 20% of Crohn's disease cases involve both the small and large intestines, which corresponds to the description of Ileocolonic Crohn's Disease.

    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:32242028
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn's disease, including a dysregulated immune system... The uncontrolled activation of the immune system toward antigens contained in the gut lumen in genetically predisposed subjects is believed to be the leading cause of inflammatory bowel disease.
        explanation: The statement is supported as one of the major factors causing Crohn's Disease is the dysregulated immune system attacking the gastrointestinal tract.
      - reference: PMID:36720220
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. CD is multifactorial, involving the complex interplay of genetic, immune, and environmental factors... we mapped markers of disease-associated myofibroblast activation and identified CHMP1A, TBX3, and RNF168 as regulators of fibrotic complications.
        explanation: This study supports the mechanism involving the immune system leading to inflammation and chronic disease in the gastrointestinal tract.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Crohn's disease (CD) is a major form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by transmural inflammation along the alimentary tract. Changes in the microbial composition and reduction in species diversity are recognized as pivotal hallmarks in disease dynamics, challenging the gut barrier function and shaping a pathological immune response in genetically influenced subjects.
        explanation: This study details changes in microbial composition and reduction in species diversity as key factors in the dynamics of Crohn's Disease, thereby supporting the statement.
      - reference: PMID:18810765
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The pathogenesis of both disease phenotypes is complex, the likely primary defect lies in the innate rather than adaptive immunity, particularly in the chemical antimicrobial barrier of the mucosa. This ileal and colonic defect in innate defense mediated by a deficiency of the protective alpha- and beta-defensins may enable the luminal microbes to invade the mucosa and trigger the inflammation.
        explanation: This study indicates that defects in innate defense mechanisms allow microbial invasion, which triggers inflammation, supporting the involvement of microbiota alterations in Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:23971750
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are both inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Both types of inflammatory bowel disease have a complex etiology, resulting from a genetically determined susceptibility interacting with environmental factors, including the diet and gut microbiota.
        explanation: This article mentions the role of gut microbiota as an environmental factor in the etiology of Crohn's Disease, supporting the contribution of microbiome imbalance to disease mechanisms.

    presence: Elevated
    context: Intestinal inflammation
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:31088326
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Calprotectin, a cytosolic protein derived predominantly from neutrophils, is now widely used in this capacity. Calprotectin is found in various bodily fluids at concentrations proportional to the degree of inflammation, including in feces at levels roughly six times higher than in the blood. Fecal calprotectin (FCP) therefore reflects intestinal inflammation.
        explanation: The statement is supported by the literature, which indicates that fecal calprotectin levels are elevated in the context of intestinal inflammation, consistent with the presence of Crohn's Disease.
      - reference: PMID:37999894
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Fecal calprotectin was negatively correlated with glycolithocholic acid (GLCA) and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) in UC. These bile acids were reduced in stool of UC patients with fecal calprotectin levels > 500 microg/g compared to UC patients with low calprotectin levels.
        explanation: Although this study focuses on ulcerative colitis, it corroborates the finding that fecal calprotectin levels are elevated in the context of intestinal inflammation.

treatments:
  - name: Isoniazid
    description: First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.
    notes: It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
    mechanism:
      - name: Prodrug Activation
        description: Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.
      - name: Inhibition of InhA
        description: The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids.
      - name: Depletion of mycolic acids
        description: By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria resist the host's immune response.
      - name: Cell wall disruption
        description: The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the host's immune defenses and other antibiotics.
      - name: Reactive oxygen species
        description: In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.
      - name: Bactericidal action
        description: The combination of cell wall disruption and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ultimately leads to the death of the M. tuberculosis bacteria.

There is a common variation in the genetic sequence of the COMT gene, which causes a dramatic change in its enzyme activity. In people with schizophrenia, in their healthy siblings, and also in normal controls, the COMT genotype predicts 4% of the variation in human executive cognition and working memory. We have thus identified a genetic mechanism in the human species that affects the efficiency and efficacy of information-processing in the prefrontal cortex. It is, also, a weak genetic risk factor for schizophrenia: in family studies, it increases the risk of schizophrenia by 50-80%.'

        snippet: Malignant melanoma represents a neoplasm stemming from melanocytes or the cells that develop from melanocytes. Melanocytes, pigment-producing cells, arise from the neural crest and migrate to their final destinations in the skin, uveal tract, meninges, and mucosa. Most melanocytes are found at the epidermal-dermal junction of the skin, and the vast majority of melanocytes arise from cutaneous sites. Cancerous growths develop when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanning beds) triggers mutations (genetic defects) that lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumours.

review_notes: Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can cause rapid and severe dehydration that can be lethal. Additional key features include "rice-water" diarrhea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis due to the massive fluid losses. Hypovolemic shock is the most severe complication. Rapid fluid and electrolyte replacement is critical.
