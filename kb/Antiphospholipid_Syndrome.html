                        Among this cohort in 2000-2015, 33 cases of incident APS, as defined by the Sydney criteria, were identified... The estimated prevalence of APS was 50 (95% CI 42-58) per 100,000 population, and was similar in both sexes.

                        The prevalence of APS is reported as 50 per 100,000 population, which translates to 0.05%. However, this value is for all types of APS, not exclusively primary APS.

                        A connection between cigarette smoking and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) was first reported in the late 1980s. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with aPL are more likely to be smokers than those without aPL. These patients have a particularly high frequency of vascular events.

                        The literature indicates there is some association between smoking and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, particularly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, it notes that the association has not been systematically examined and the connection is complicated by other factors. Therefore, it does not fully support a direct connection between smoking and antiphospholipid syndrome as an environmental factor.
