                        The viewpoint that vitiligo is not caused only by predisposing mutations, or only by melanocytes responding to chemical/radiation exposure, or only by hyperreactive T cells, but rather results from a combination of aetiologic factors that impact melanocyte viability, has certainly stood the test of time.

                        The convergence theory supports the idea that multiple genetic and environmental factors contribute to vitiligo.

                        Vitiligo in children is a distinct subset of vitiligo and differs from adult vitiligo. Characteristic features include family history of autoimmune or endocrine disease, higher incidence of segmental vitiligo, development of early or premature graying, increased incidence of autoantibodies and poor response to topical PUVA.
