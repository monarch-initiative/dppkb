                        Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by a variety of symptoms, including arthropathy. The clinical presentation of joint involvement varies, ranging from arthralgia without erosions or deformity to an erosive arthropathy and severe functional disability.
