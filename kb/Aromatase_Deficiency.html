                        INTRODUCTION: cP450aromatase deficiency provides clues for the understanding of the role of aromatase in prepubertal and pubertal human health and disease. Placental aromatization of androgens protects the female fetus against the virilizing action of fetal androgens. After birth, the dual effect of aromatase deficiency, excessive androgens, and insufficient estrogens is responsible for a variable clinical picture. Nineteen cases of aromatase gene (CYP19) deficiency have been reported.

                        The abstract explains that aromatase deficiency has implications from birth through adolescence, with effects noticeable from early childhood due to the imbalance of androgens and estrogens. This supports the statement that aromatase deficiency impacts this age range.

                        Human congenital estrogen deficiency, due to an inactivating mutation of the aromatase gene, leads to the lack of the estrogen synthesis, with gonadotropins and circulating testosterone ranging from normal to elevated. The aromatase-deficient females show hyperandrogenism and virilization at birth with ambiguous genitalia. During childhood there are a dysfunction in the LHRH-LH/FSH axis and a progressive delay in bone age.

Transdermal estradiol treatment at a daily dose of about 25 microg might be adequate for lifelong replacement therapy.
