treatments_0_name=Isoniazid
treatments_0_description='First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.'
treatments_0_notes='It'"'"'s important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.'
treatments_0_mechanism_0_name='Prodrug Activation'
treatments_0_mechanism_0_description='Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.'
treatments_0_mechanism_1_name='Inhibition of InhA'
treatments_0_mechanism_1_description='The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids.'
treatments_0_mechanism_2_name='Depletion of mycolic acids'
treatments_0_mechanism_2_description='By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria resist the host'"'"'s immune response.'

treatments_0_mechanism_3_description='The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the host'"'"'s immune defenses and other antibiotics.'
treatments_0_mechanism_4_name='Reactive oxygen species'
treatments_0_mechanism_4_description='In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.'

treatments_0_mechanism_5_description='The combination of cell wall disruption and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ultimately leads to the death of the M. tuberculosis bacteria.'
treatments_1_name=Rifampicin
treatments_1_description='Bactericidal antibiotic used for TB treatment.'
treatments_1_notes='Rifampicin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is particularly effective against mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis, as it can easily penetrate the lipid-rich cell wall.'

treatments_2_description='Bacteriostatic antibiotic used for TB treatment.'
treatments_2_notes='Ethambutol is specific to mycobacteria and is often used in combination with other antitubercular drugs to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.'
