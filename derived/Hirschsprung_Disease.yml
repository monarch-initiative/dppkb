        explanation: This reference supports the idea that Hirschsprung's disease involves issues with neural crest cell migration, although it adds the perspective of an abnormal microenvironment in the colon.
  - name: Disrupted Enteric Nervous System Development
    description: The lack of ganglion cells causes a disruption in enteric nervous system function, leading to bowel motility issues.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:20610192
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by the absence of the enteric nervous system in a variable portion of the distal gut.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Symptoms of abdominal discomfort are frequently encountered in the daily practice of pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. Normal peristalsis depends on the interaction between muscles, nerve cells, and tendinous connective tissue of muscularis propria. Malfunction of any of these components results in a motility disorder. Aganglionosis, typically of the left distal colon, is the cause of Hirschsprung disease.
        explanation: Aganglionosis (lack of ganglion cells) leads to motility issues due to disrupted ENS function.
