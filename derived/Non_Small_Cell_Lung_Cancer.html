                        Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present neoantigens through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune evasion. Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA LOH occurs in 40% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic activity, and PD-L1 positivity.

                        Since MHC-I antigen presentation is not essential for cell growth or survival, many cancers inactivate this pathway, and thereby escape control by CD8 T cells.

                        Our results are suggestive for particular site- and sequence-specific metastasis patterns in human SCLC. SCLC bone metastases tend to appear together with liver metastases, while brain metastases occur together with adrenal gland metastases.

                        While this article primarily deals with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), it does mention metastasis pattern to common sites such as liver and adrenal glands, indicating support for the general concept of lung cancer metastasizing to these distant organs.

                        Nearly 75% of patients have a disseminated carcinoma at diagnosis. Up to 50% of patients with localized disease will develop metastasis. Nevertheless, the current scientific evidence has demonstrated that when the metastatic disease is limited, particularly in specific locations such as the brain and the adrenal glands, a multidisciplinary approach with radical intent could achieve a longer survival.

                        At least one third of the people with lung cancer develop brain metastases at some point during their disease, even often before the diagnosis of lung cancer is made. The high rate of brain metastasis makes lung cancer the most common type of tumor to spread to the brain.

                        Pathologic activation of MET can be achieved with increased number of gene copies overexpression, or decreased protein degradation through several mechanisms, including mutations, amplifications, or fusions. Besides its role as primary driver, MET activation might also mediate resistance to kinase inhibitors in NSCLC with various other actionable alterations.

                        One of the reasons patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer are not fit for treatment is cancer cachexia, which is common (upto 75% of patients) in this group. This metabolic syndrome presents clinically as weight loss (muscle +/- fat), decreased physical function (patients less active) and anorexia on a background of systemic inflammation.

                        Smoking is a major risk factor for a variety of diseases, including cancer and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Tobacco smoke contains a mixture of chemicals, including a host of reactive oxygen- and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), among others, that can damage cellular and sub-cellular targets.
