treatments:
  - name: Isoniazid
    description: First-line antibiotic for TB treatment.
    notes: It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
    mechanism:
      - name: Prodrug Activation
        description: Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.
      - name: Inhibition of InhA
        description: The activated form of isoniazid binds to and inhibits the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), an enzyme involved in the fatty acid synthase II (FAS-II) pathway. This pathway is essential for the synthesis of mycolic acids.
      - name: Depletion of mycolic acids
        description: By inhibiting InhA, isoniazid prevents the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids that make up a significant portion of the mycobacterial cell wall. Mycolic acids provide structural integrity and help the bacteria resist the host's immune response.
      - name: Cell wall disruption
        description: The depletion of mycolic acids leads to the weakening and disruption of the bacterial cell wall. This makes the bacteria more susceptible to the host's immune defenses and other antibiotics.
      - name: Reactive oxygen species
        description: In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.
      - name: Bactericidal action
        description: The combination of cell wall disruption and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ultimately leads to the death of the M. tuberculosis bacteria.
  - name: Rifampicin
    description: Bactericidal antibiotic used for TB treatment.
    notes: Rifampicin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is particularly effective against mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis, as it can easily penetrate the lipid-rich cell wall.
    mechanism:
      - name: Inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase
        description: Rifampicin binds to the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing the initiation of RNA synthesis.
      - name: Disruption of bacterial transcription
        description: By inhibiting RNA polymerase, rifampicin disrupts bacterial transcription, which is essential for protein synthesis and bacterial survival.
  - name: Ethambutol
    description: Bacteriostatic antibiotic used for TB treatment.
    notes: Ethambutol is specific to mycobacteria and is often used in combination with other antitubercular drugs to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
    mechanism:
      - name: Inhibition of arabinogalactan synthesis
        description: Ethambutol interferes with the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, a key component of the mycobacterial cell wall.
      - name: Inhibition of arabinosyl transferase
        description: Ethambutol inhibits the enzyme arabinosyl transferase, which is responsible for the polymerization of arabinose into arabinan, a precursor of arabinogalactan.
      - name: Compromised cell wall integrity
        description: By disrupting the synthesis of arabinogalactan, ethambutol compromises the integrity of the cell wall, making the bacteria more susceptible to host defenses and other antibiotics.
  - name: Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)
    description: Health worker observes and records patients taking their medication to ensure adherence.
  - name: Latent TB Treatment
    description: Isoniazid or rifapentine used to prevent latent TB from becoming active.
notes: TB is a significant global health issue, particularly in low-income and developing countries.
