                        The article explains that insulin deficiency leads to increased lipolysis, which eventually results in the production of ketone bodies. This supports the statement's claim about the pathophysiology involving lipolysis and ketone production in Type I Diabetes.

                        The remaining 15 to 20% of patients have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a disorder caused by the destruction of insulin-producing endocrine cells within the pancreas and currently considered to be the result of an autoimmune process. During the course of both types of diabetes mellitus, the so-called long-term complications of diabetes invariably occur to some extent in all patients. These complications include retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and premature atherosclerosis.

                        Immune-mediated (auto-immune) Type 1 diabetes mellitus is not a homogenous entity, but nonetheless has distinctive characteristics. In children, it may present with classical insulin deficiency and ketoacidosis at disease onset, whereas autoimmune diabetes in adults may not always be insulin dependent.

          Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. The hallmark is hyperglycemia, which causes many acute symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, as well as long-term complications in multiple organ systems if blood sugars are not well-controlled. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious acute complication of insulin deficiency.
