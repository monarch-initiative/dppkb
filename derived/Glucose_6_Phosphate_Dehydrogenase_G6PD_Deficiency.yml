        snippet: 33% of patients had Hb < 50 g/L and were all transfused. 50% had Hb between 50 and 65 g/L, half of them (n = 49) did not receive transfusion and only two patients (4%) required transfusion upon follow up. A restrictive transfusion strategy was adopted...
        explanation: This study indicates that during acute hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient children, blood transfusions were given to those with severe anemia, supporting the necessity of blood transfusion for severe cases.
      - reference: PMID:16225031
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Because acute hemolysis is caused by exposure to an oxidative stressor in the form of an infection, oxidative drug, or fava beans, treatment is geared toward avoidance of these and other stressors. Acute hemolysis is self-limited, but in rare instances it can be severe enough to warrant a blood transfusion.
        explanation: The statement that management involves hydration, blood transfusions when necessary, and monitoring for complications aligns with the literature, which suggests blood transfusion in severe cases and the self-limited nature of acute hemolysis.
