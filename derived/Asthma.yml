        explanation: The reference discusses subtypes of adult-onset asthma and emphasizes the importance of different risk factors, which supports that adult-onset asthma could have environmental triggers.
      - reference: PMID:30240884
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Adult-onset asthma is an important asthma phenotype and, in contrast to childhood asthma, is often associated with specific triggers of onset.

      - reference: PMID:20176257
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Exposure to unusual substances at work causes occupational asthma, accounting for about 5% of asthma in adults. Indoor and outdoor air pollutants trigger airway inflammation and increase the severity of asthma.
        explanation: The literature specifies that environmental factors such as pollutants can trigger adult asthma, further supporting the statement about environmental triggers.

      - reference: PMID:24507842
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Asthma in childhood and COPD in smokers have their own phenotypic expression with underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that differ importantly. In older adults, asthma and COPD are more difficult to differentiate and there exists a bronchodilator response in most but not all patients with asthma and persistent airway obstruction in most but not all patients with COPD where even up to 50% have been reported to have some bronchodilator response as assessed with FEV1.
        explanation: The article acknowledges overlapping phenotypes between asthma and COPD, supporting the existence of a subtype with features of both diseases.
