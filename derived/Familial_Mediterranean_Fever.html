                        Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in MEFV, which encodes pyrin, an inflammasome protein. Heterozygous carrier frequencies for multiple MEFV mutations are high in several Mediterranean populations, suggesting that they confer selective advantage.

As in previous reports on arthritis of FMF, the majority of FMF patients studied in Lebanon had a transient monoarticular nonerosive and nondeforming type of arthritis affecting predominantly the large joints of the lower extremities.
