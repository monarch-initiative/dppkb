[...] Excluding the Haitian epidemic, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 86 % of reported cases and 99 % of deaths worldwide in 2011.

                        We also show that, in our model, effective reproduction numbers and epidemicity indices are explicitly related. Therefore, providing an upper bound to the effective reproduction number (significantly lower than the unit threshold) warrants negative epidemicity and, in turn, a rapidly fading outbreak preventing coalescence of sparse local sub-threshold flare-ups.

                        Cholera is a diarrheal disease that results from colonization of the small intestine by the Vibrio cholerae organism. The disease is spread primarily by means of fecal contamination of drinking water and may begin with the sudden onset of profuse, watery diarrhea. Vomiting, rapid dehydration, acidosis, muscular cramps and circulatory collapse are other prominent features of severe cholera.

                        We estimate the median incubation period of toxigenic cholera to be 1.4 days (95% CI, 1.3-1.6). Five percent of cholera cases will develop symptoms by 0.5 days (95% CI 0.4-0.5), and 95% by 4.4 days (95% CI 3.9-5.0) after infection.

                        The incubation period can be very short and it takes between several hours and 5 days. The most common symptoms of the illness are diarrhoea, dehydration, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Case-fatality rate is lower than 1%, if rehydration treatment is prescribed rapidly, but it can exceed 70% in patients not treated properly.

                        Vibrio cholerae was the most common pathogen isolated (12,405 patients; 22%), and had the strongest association with SD (AOR 4.77; 95% CI: 4.41-5.51).

                        For more than two decades, WHO and UNICEF have recommended a single formulation of oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution based on glucose and three salts. This product has proven safe and highly effective in treating and preventing dehydration from diarrhoea of all causes and in all age groups in worldwide use and has substantially contributed to the saving of lives in developing countries.

                        The use of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is supported as a treatment for cholera, as it involves a mixture of water, salts, and glucose to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.

                        The data contrast with the rarity of treatment failures of oral glucose-electrolyte solutions. Glucose, therefore, is preferable to sucrose for oral therapy of diarrhoeal diseases.

                        This article describes a rapid, simple and reproducible method for detecting Vibrio cholerae in diarrhoeal patients. The method involves darkfield examination of a liquid stool specimen or a rectal swab immersed in broth and immobilization of V. cholerae by the addition of specific vibrio antisera.

                        The method mentioned in the article uses darkfield microscopy to detect Vibrio cholerae in stool samples, aligning with the statement that darkfield microscopy can show motile Vibrio cholerae in a fresh stool sample.

                        At the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, one-half of the rice-water stool samples that were culture-positive for Vibrio cholerae did not contain motile V. cholerae by standard darkfield microscopy and were defined as darkfield-negative (DF(-)).

                        While darkfield microscopy is used to detect motile Vibrio cholerae, the study indicates that it may not always be successful in detecting motile bacteria in all stool samples, leading to 'darkfield-negative' results in some instances.

          Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It can cause rapid and severe dehydration that can be lethal. Additional key features include "rice-water" diarrhea, vomiting, and electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis due to the massive fluid losses. Hypovolemic shock is the most severe complication. Rapid fluid and electrolyte replacement is critical.
