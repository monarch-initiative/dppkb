                        Since the first description of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) was published in 1942...large inter-individual variability in the phenotypic presentation has been demonstrated... Evidence from the existing literature of KS indicates that not just one single genetic mechanism can explain the phenotype and the variable expressivity.

                        This study suggests that most males born with these chromosome patterns will go through life without being karyotyped, that the commonest indication for a Klinefelter male to be karyotyped will be hypogonadism and/or infertility.
