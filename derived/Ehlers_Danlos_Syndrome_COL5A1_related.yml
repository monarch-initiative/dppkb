    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:9042913
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The mutation causes the substitution of the most 5' cysteine residue by a serine within a highly conserved sequence of the pro(alpha)1(V) C-propeptide domain and causes reduction of collagen V by preventing incorporation of the mutant pro(alpha)1(V) chains in the collagen V trimers.
        explanation: This reference describes how mutations in COL5A1 lead to defective synthesis and assembly of collagen type V, supporting the given statement.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen.
        explanation: The literature indicates that mutations in the COL5A1 gene lead to abnormalities in collagen type V, resulting in weakened connective tissues.
      - reference: PMID:15095409
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: EDS cells with COL5A1 haplo-insufficiency deposited less than one-half of hydroxyproline as collagen compared to control fibroblasts. This deficit in type V collagen was associated with the assembly of significantly fewer fibrils compared to control.
        explanation: This study demonstrates that reduced type V collagen results in weaker connective tissue due to a significant decrease in collagen fibril assembly.
      - reference: PMID:12836217
