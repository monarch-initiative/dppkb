        snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. The presence of autoantibodies in the sera of RA patients has provided many clues to the underlying disease pathophysiology. Based on the presence of several autoantibodies like rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)... RA can be subdivided into seropositive and seronegative disease.
        explanation: The literature indicates that RA can be subdivided into seropositive and seronegative types based on the presence of RF and/or ACPAs in the sera of the patients, which supports the given statement.

        snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is subdivided into seropositive and seronegative disease based on the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).
        explanation: The study confirms the classification of RA into seropositive and seronegative types, which hinges on the presence of RF and/or ACPA.
  - name: Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis
    description: Absence of both RF and anti-CCP antibodies, but with typical clinical features of RA.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:33329548
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Traditionally, RA is divided into seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) disease forms, the latter consisting of an array of unrelated diseases with joint involvement.
        explanation: This study discusses SN-RA as a form characterized by the absence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF), supporting the statement.
      - reference: PMID:3266362
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: We became increasingly concerned with the problem of defining properly patients with seronegative RA. Both the statement of seronegativity with regard to rheumatoid factors (RF), the diagnosis of RA, and particularly the exclusion of cases of seronegative arthritis other than RA were difficult.
        explanation: This study acknowledges the existence of seronegative RA defined by the absence of RF.
      - reference: PMID:32678001
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is classified as seropositive or seronegative, depending on the presence/absence of rheumatoid factor (RF), primarily IgM RF, and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), commonly detected using anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) assays.
        explanation: This supports the seronegative classification based on the absence of RF and anti-CCP antibodies but points out the complexity and variability within seronegative RA.
      - reference: PMID:38251565
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The subset of rheumatoid arthritis that does not have autoantibodies (such as rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies) remains less well defined in its pathogenic mechanisms.
        explanation: Refers to RA without autoantibodies, supporting the statement that such a subtype exists.

        snippet: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an umbrella term for arthritis of unknown origin, lasting for >6 weeks with onset before 16 years of age.
        explanation: The literature specifies that JIA is defined as arthritis lasting for more than 6 weeks with onset before 16 years, aligning with the statement. However, JIA is not a subtype of Rheumatoid Arthritis but rather a distinct condition.

        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: To determine the spectrum of clinical presentation, laboratory parameters and drug therapy in patients with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA).

        snippet: Childhood-onset rheumatoid arthritis (CORA), known as rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis that shares the same genetic factors and clinical features as adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis.
        explanation: This literature mentions that RF-positive juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a type of JIA sharing features with adult RA. It confirms that JIA has clinical overlap with RA but does not support that JIA is a subtype of RA.
      - reference: PMID:8465574

        snippet: A study in the UK found the population minimum prevalence of RA is 1.16% in women and 0.44% in men. In Australia, the estimated prevalence is 0.6%.
        explanation: While the prevalence of RA in the UK and Australia provides values that fall both below and slightly within the stated range (0.5-1.0%), it does not consistently support the global prevalence within that range.
      - reference: PMID:32712723
        supports: REFUTE
        snippet: According to the most recently published systematic reviews, pooled prevalence estimates for RA are 0.38% in North America, and 0.21 to 0.25% in European subregions.
        explanation: The prevalence estimates for North America and European subregions are significantly below the stated range (0.5-1.0%), thus not supporting the statement.

        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: It suggests that the term 'early rheumatoid arthritis' is not appropriate and that patients either have established rheumatoid arthritis or an undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.
        explanation: This reference argues against the categorization of 'early rheumatoid arthritis' and suggests that RA should be considered either as established or undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, providing no evidence about the progression specifically at the onset phase.
      - reference: PMID:23926091
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: "However, little is known about the characteristics of symptoms at the onset of a disease that eventually progresses to RA… In order for clinicians to fully understand the earliest phases of disease, the nature of symptoms at onset needs to be understood."
        explanation: This study highlights the lack of comprehensive knowledge on the characteristics and progression of RA in its earliest phases, thus providing no evidence regarding the progression of RA specifically at the onset phase.

        snippet: The disease severity increases with increase in the age and reaches to its peak in above 60 years of age (p=0.001). The pattern of progression of RA in the Pakistani patients is almost consistent with other relevant studies conducted on European and European derived populations.
        explanation: This study indicates that the progression of rheumatoid arthritis increases with age and is most severe in patients above 60. This indirectly supports the statement that progression can be observed in the age range of 30-60, by confirming its increase towards the upper end of this range.
      - reference: PMID:34894251
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Patients with all EORA features were more numerous with age and almost exclusively older than 65 years.
        explanation: This supports the idea that progression features become more prominent with age. As such, rheumatoid arthritis progression can be inferred for the age range of 30-60.

        snippet: A study in the UK found the population minimum prevalence of RA is 1.16% in women and 0.44% in men.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with progressive articular damage. Activated cells of the synovium produce pro-inflammatory and matrix-degrading effector molecules, which maintain the inflammation and lead to the destruction of the involved joints. In addition to macrophages and T- and B-cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes must be considered key cells in driving the pathological processes. They can be distinguished by their transformed-appearing phenotype and their invasion into adjacent cartilage and bone.
        explanation: The literature describes that fibroblast-like synoviocytes and macrophages play a key role in the inflammation and invasion of cartilage and bone in RA, supporting the statement.
