        snippet: We report a case of monkeypox in the United States in a patient who had been vaccinated with ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine 8 years earlier. Despite his vaccination status, he still contracted disease.
        explanation: This case indicates that the patient contracted monkeypox despite vaccination, suggesting limited or no cross-protection by the ACAM2000 vaccine.

        snippet: Monkeypox (MPXV) and cowpox (CPXV) are emerging agents that cause severe human infections on an intermittent basis, and variola virus (VARV) has potential for use as an agent of bioterror. Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) has been used therapeutically to treat severe orthopoxvirus infections but is in short supply.
        explanation: This reference mentions broader cross-protective immunity for orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox, suggesting a potential for cross-protection, though specifics about the smallpox vaccine's efficacy aren't detailed.

        snippet: Two vaccines are currently available, JYNNEOS(TM) (live, replication incompetent vaccinia virus) and ACAM2000((R)) (live, replication competent vaccinia virus).
        explanation: The presence of orthopoxvirus vaccines like ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS indicates their consideration in the context of monkeypox prevention, implying potential cross-protection.

        snippet: It has been observed that smallpox vaccines can be used to protect against MPX. The present article highlights the significant points and various issues for vaccines and vaccinations that should be considered related to MPX.
        explanation: The use of smallpox vaccines for protection against monkeypox is explicitly mentioned, supporting the potential for cross-protection.

        snippet: Monkeypox is an infectious disease, characterised by a rash affecting the skin and soft tissues, including the oral cavity.
        explanation: The literature mentions the importance of infection control in preventing the spread of monkeypox, particularly in dental settings.
review_notes: Added additional common symptoms including headache, fatigue, GI symptoms, sore throat and conjunctivitis, to provide a more complete clinical picture. Noted typical rash progression and that fever usually comes before rash.
