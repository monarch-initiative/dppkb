                        The peroxisome is a subcellular organelle that functions in essential metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of plasmalogens, fatty acid beta-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids, and degradation of hydrogen peroxide. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) manifest as severe dysfunction in multiple organs, including the central nervous system (CNS), but the pathogenic mechanisms in PBDs are largely unknown.

                        Peroxisomopathies are rare diseases due to dysfunctions of the peroxisome in which this organelle is either absent or with impaired activities. These diseases... affect the central and peripheral nervous system.
