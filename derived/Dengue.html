                        Dengue fever is one of the most common mosquito-borne viral illnesses in the world. It is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito. Dengue infections are caused by four antigenically distinct but closely related viruses (DEN 1–4).

                        Since the 1960s, numerous reports have identified a second heterologous dengue virus (DENV) infection as a principal risk factor for severe dengue disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, DHF/DSS). Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus infection has been proposed as the early mechanism underlying DHF/DSS.

                        Known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, the phenomenon occurs when virus-antibody immunocomplexes interact with cells bearing complement or Fc receptors, promoting internalization of the virus and increasing infection.

                        Thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction are common in both cases and are related to the clinical outcome. Different mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain DENV-associated thrombocytopenia, including the suppression of bone marrow and the peripheral destruction of platelets.

                        Dengue fever is endemic in Pakistan with seasonal rise in cases. Morbidities and mortalities are proportionately reported to be increasing and associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in haemorrhagic or thrombotic manifestations in patients having deranged coagulation profiles.

                        Dengue is a vector-borne disease that has a significant impact on global public health. The disease is widespread across the world, posing a risk to nearly half of the world's population.

                        The Singapore dengue control programme succeeded in reducing the dengue force of infection... Key to this success is consideration of dengue as an environmental disease, with a strong focus on source reduction and other environmental management methods as the dominant vector control strategy.
