                        Hypertension represents a major contributor to the development of coronary artery disease. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the link between hypertension and CAD are complex and include overactivation of neurohormones, accelerated development of the atherosclerotic plaque, endothelial dysfunction, altered intramyocardial coronary circulation, hypertension-mediated cardiac and vascular damage and the relationship between arterial stiffness and coronary perfusion.

                        Pathologic cardiac hypertrophy is a common consequence of many cardiovascular diseases, including aortic stenosis (AS). AS is known to increase the pressure load of the left ventricle, causing a compensative response of the cardiac muscle, which progressively will lead to dilation and heart failure.

                        Hypertension is associated with the remodeling of left ventricular geometry and abnormalities of function that may precede geometric changes. Rather than a specific disease, 'hypertensive heart failure' is a spectrum of disorders that result from left ventricular geometric changes and comorbid conditions.

                        Ischemic heart disease still represents a large burden on individuals and health care resources worldwide. By conventions, it is equated with atherosclerotic plaque due to flow-limiting obstruction in large-medium sized coronary arteries. However, clinical, angiographic and autoptic findings suggest a multifaceted pathophysiology for ischemic heart disease and just some cases are caused by severe or complicated atherosclerotic plaques.

                        In response to increased peripheral resistance in hypertension, intensified mechanical stretch in the myocardium induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast activation to withstand increased pressure overload. This changes the structure and function of the heart, leading to pathological cardiac remodeling and eventual progression to heart failure.

                        Diffuse myocardial fibrosis resulting from the excessive deposition of collagen fibres through the entire myocardium is encountered in a number of chronic cardiac diseases. This lesion results from alterations in the regulation of fibrillary collagen turnover by fibroblasts, facilitating the excessive deposition of type I and type III collagen fibres within the myocardial interstitium and around intramyocardial vessels.

                        In left ventricular pressure overload a reactive interstitial fibrosis, having distinctive biochemical and structural features, is seen. This reactive fibrosis occurs in the absence of myocyte necrosis, is progressive in nature, and initially is an adaptive response that preserves the force generating capacity, or active (systolic) stiffness, of the hypertrophied myocardium.

                        Left ventricular (LV) diastolic function can be most conveniently assessed by echocardiography which provides reliable assessments of LV structure and function.

                        This reference supports the statement by indicating that echocardiography is useful in assessing both diastolic and systolic functions as well as left ventricular structural changes, including hypertrophy, which are related to hypertensive heart disease.

Also expanded on potential complications in other organ systems like the brain and kidneys. The cardiovascular manifestations are the most prominent, but the systemic effects of hypertension should not be overlooked.
