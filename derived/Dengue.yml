    downstream:
      - Immune System Activation

      - B Cell
    downstream:
      - Cytokine Release
      - Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)
  - name: Cytokine Release
    description: Infected cells and activated immune cells release a variety of cytokines and chemokines, contributing to the inflammatory response and disease pathogenesis.
    biological_processes:
      - TNF-alpha Production
      - IL-1beta Production
      - IL-6 Production
      - IL-8 Production
      - IFN-gamma Production
    downstream:
      - Endothelial Dysfunction
      - Vascular Leakage
      - Coagulopathy
  - name: Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE)
    description: In secondary infections with a different DENV serotype, pre-existing antibodies can enhance viral entry into cells, leading to increased viral replication and more severe disease.
    mechanisms:
      - Fc Receptor-Mediated Uptake
      - Increased Viral Load
    downstream:
      - Severe Dengue
      - Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
      - Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)
  - name: Endothelial Dysfunction
    description: DENV infection and the resulting inflammatory response cause damage to the endothelial cells lining blood vessels, leading to increased permeability and fluid leakage.
    mechanisms:
      - Cytokine-Induced Damage
      - Endothelial Cell Apoptosis
    downstream:
      - Vascular Leakage
      - Plasma Leakage
      - Hemoconcentration
  - name: Coagulopathy
    description: DENV infection can disrupt the balance of the coagulation system, leading to abnormalities in platelet function and an increased risk of bleeding.
    mechanisms:
      - Thrombocytopenia
      - Platelet Dysfunction
      - Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
    downstream:
