name: Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorder
category: Genetic
parents:
  - Inborn Error of Metabolism
  - Peroxisomal Disorder
prevalence:
  - population: Global
    percentage: Very Rare
inheritance:
  - name: Autosomal recessive
pathophysiology:
  - name: Peroxisome Biogenesis Defect
    description: Mutations in PEX genes disrupt the assembly and function of peroxisomes, leading to impaired metabolic processes.
    cellular_components:
      - Peroxisome
  - name: Accumulation of Toxic Metabolites
    description: The inability to break down very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and other compounds leads to their accumulation in tissues.
    chemical_entities:
      - VLCFAs
      - Bile Acid Intermediates
      - Phytanic Acid
  - name: Deficiency of Essential Compounds
    description: Impaired synthesis of plasmalogens and other essential compounds disrupts normal cellular functions.
    chemical_entities:
      - Plasmalogen
  - name: Neurological Dysfunction
    locations:
      - central nervous system
    description: Accumulation of toxic metabolites and deficiency of essential compounds lead to demyelination, neuronal migration defects, and neurodegeneration.
  - name: Hepatic Dysfunction
    locations:
      - liver
    description: Accumulation of bile acid intermediates and VLCFAs, along with oxidative stress, cause hepatomegaly, fibrosis, and liver failure.
  - name: Skeletal Abnormalities
    locations:
      - bones
      - cartilage
    description: Plasmalogen deficiency disrupts normal bone formation, leading to rhizomelic shortening of limbs and chondrodysplasia punctata.
  - name: Multisystem Involvement
    description: The pervasive nature of peroxisomal dysfunction affects multiple organ systems, resulting in a wide range of clinical manifestations.
