His view that the process of dementia should be seen as a mosaic of circumscribed neuropsychological deficits and not as a diffuse degradation of mental abilities is essential for progress in a cognitive neuropsychological approach to the study of dementias.

                        Pick's disease is a type of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with circumscribed atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe.

                        The literature states that Pick's disease involves atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe, which aligns with neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes as described.

                        Neuropsychiatric disorders in patients and their families are associated with cognitive and behavioural changes post-MND diagnosis, with many occurring independently of MND-FTD and C9orf72 status.

                        MND (Motor Neuron Disease) does overlap with frontotemporal dementia and associated behavioral changes, but this is not directly related to Pick's disease and does not provide evidence for high-frequency psychiatric phenotypes in Pick's disease.

          Pick disease is a type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, and language. Motor symptoms like parkinsonism can emerge later in the course. Memory is relatively spared early on, in contrast to Alzheimer disease.
