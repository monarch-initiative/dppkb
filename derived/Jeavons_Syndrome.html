                        Jeavons syndrome (JS, eyelid myoclonia with absences [EMA]) consists of a triad of symptoms including eyelid myoclonia that may be accompanied by absence seizures, eye closure-induced EEG paroxysms or seizures, and photosensitivity. The age of onset ranges between 2 and 14 years with symptoms peaking between 6 and 8 years of age.

                        Jeavons syndrome is an underreported epileptic syndrome characterized by eyelid myoclonia, eyelid closure-induced seizures or electroencephalography paroxysms, and photosensitivity. Drug-resistant epilepsy is common, but the prognostic factors and clinical course leading to drug resistance have not been well characterized.

                        JS has been proposed as idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) because of normal posterior dominant background activity and paroxysmal generalized ictal epileptiform discharges (EDs). However, we noticed subtle occipital EDs preceding EM and interictal posterior EDs using digital video-EEG... Further clinical observations of seizures induced by eye closure, photic stimulation, and hyperventilation along with EEG paroxysms would raise the possibility of the occipital cortex initiating generalized epilepsy network involving the brainstem, and thalamocortical and transcortical pathways in JS.

                        The literature indicates involvement of the occipital cortex and mentions generalized epilepsy networks, which may include the thalamus. However, it does not explicitly support the claim that disruptions in the visual cortex and thalamus are the predominant mechanisms in Jeavons Syndrome.

                        Largely accepted in the literature is the role the interconnections between the thalamus and cortex play in generalized epilepsy. However, thalamocortical involvement is less understood in focal epilepsy in terms of the effect of seizures on thalamocortical circuitry in the developing brain and subsequent cognitive outcome.

                        The statement is partially supported because generalized tonic-clonic seizures occur in 70% of patients, which suggests a high frequency rather than 'occasional'.

                        All participants completed neuropsychological evaluations. Statistical analyses revealed performance that was below average on measures of global IQ, processing speed and rote, verbal learning coupled with average nonverbal reasoning, and sustained attention. There was also evidence of impaired higher-level verbal reasoning. While global IQ ranged from low average to borderline impaired, no participant could be accurately described as impaired or having intellectual disability (ID) given the consistently average performance noted on some higher-order tasks including nonverbal reasoning.

The impairments are more specific and varied, making the statement partially correct but not completely accurate.

                        Visually provoked seizures, in particular, can be prevented or treated by avoiding or altering the triggering stimulus. Apart from individual preventive measures (use of specific television or video screens, colored glasses, etc.), prevention and warning on a larger scale are helpful.
