        snippet: Throughout the years, numerous medical treatments have been used to achieve symptom control in these patients, and include medications such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, disopyramide, and angiotensin receptor blockers.
        explanation: The abstract directly mentions the use of beta-blockers to control symptoms in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, supporting the statement.

        snippet: beta-Adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are the first-line therapy for HCM. However, beta-blockers commonly selected for this disease are often poorly tolerated in patients, where heart-rate reduction and noncardiac effects can lead to reduced cardiac output and fatigue.
        explanation: This reference confirms that beta-blockers are a first-line therapy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and are used for heart rate reduction, supporting the statement.

        snippet: CCBs are effective antihypertensive drugs and a very good therapeutic option for HTN LVH as they can cause reverse LVH remodeling.
        explanation: The review suggests the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers in treating hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (HTN LVH), indicating a role in remodeling heart muscle, which aligns with improving blood flow.
      - reference: PMID:7004293
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The negative inotropic effects of verapamil are valuable in improving the symptoms and hemodynamic disturbances of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
        explanation: This directly supports the use of calcium channel blockers (specifically verapamil) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by improving symptoms and hemodynamics, which implies relaxing the heart muscle and improving blood flow.

        explanation: The literature directly confirms that septal myectomy is used to surgically remove part of the thickened heart muscle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.
      - reference: PMID:3665141
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Surgical septal myectomy is the preferred treatment of choice if medical treatment is unsuccessful or intolerable.
        explanation: The literature reiterates that septal myectomy is a surgical treatment for removing part of the thickened heart muscle in cases where medical treatments fail.
      - reference: PMID:31280832
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Surgical myectomy was initially advocated only for patients with symptoms refractory to maximal tolerated medical therapy.
        explanation: This supports the usage of septal myectomy for removing thickened muscle parts as a treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
      - reference: PMID:22687587
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are largely selected based on patient symptoms and echocardiographic findings.
        explanation: While this reference does not directly state septal myectomy, it mentions treatment selection based on symptoms, which aligns with the usage context of septal myectomy in other literature. Therefore, it indirectly supports the use.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Nevertheless, several observational clinical studies have shown that the ICD reliably terminates life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in HCM, and is largely responsible for reducing HCM mortality to 0.5% per year, by preventing SD and changing the natural course of the disease.
        explanation: This excerpt supports the statement by showing that ICDs prevent sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
      - reference: PMID:36396186
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are the mainstay of therapy for prevention of sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
        explanation: This excerpt also supports the statement by confirming that ICDs are a primary treatment used to prevent sudden cardiac death in high-risk HCM patients.
      - reference: PMID:22687587
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Risk of sudden death correlates with maximum left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Massive LV thickening of 30 mm or more is an indication for primary prevention of sudden death with an implanted defibrillator.
        explanation: This excerpt provides specific criteria for using ICDs as a preventative measure in patients with significant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, further supporting the statement.
      - reference: PMID:36134835
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: During follow-up of 4.8+/-3.4 years, there was no sudden cardiac death, but 20.6% patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator had at least one appropriate shock.
        explanation: While the focus is on the outcome of ICD shocks, the lack of sudden cardiac deaths among ICD patients aligns with the notion that ICDs prevent sudden cardiac death in high-risk HCM patients.
