                        Derived from neural crest cells (NCCs), this little brain controls muscle contraction, motility, and bowel activities in response to stimuli. Failure of developing enteric ganglia at the distal bowel results in intestinal obstruction and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR).

                        The literature explains that Hirschsprung disease results from the failure of developing enteric ganglia, which are derived from neural crest cells, supporting the notion of defective migration leading to absent ganglion cells.

                        Symptoms of abdominal discomfort are frequently encountered in the daily practice of pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. Normal peristalsis depends on the interaction between muscles, nerve cells, and tendinous connective tissue of muscularis propria. Malfunction of any of these components results in a motility disorder. Aganglionosis, typically of the left distal colon, is the cause of Hirschsprung disease.

The family examined in this study clearly demonstrates that (1) the genotype to phenotype correlation of patients with RET mutation-associated HD is not directly related, and (2) genetic mechanisms underlying the different HD phenotypes, as well as the model of inheritance of HD, are complex and not yet fully understood.

                        The diagnostic accuracy of HRAM (based on the ASRI10 value) is greater than that of conventional ARM for Hirschsprung disease.

                        High-resolution anorectal manometry based on ASRI10 values proves effective in diagnosing Hirschsprung disease.

                        Rectal myenteric nerve plexus stimulation is a theoretical alternative for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.

                        This study suggests manometric techniques including stimulation of the rectal myenteric nerve plexus as potentially useful in diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease.
