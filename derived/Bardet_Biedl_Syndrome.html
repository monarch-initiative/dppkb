                        More than half of BBS patients carry mutations in one of eight genes encoding for subunits of a protein complex, the BBSome, which mediates trafficking of ciliary cargoes. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of the BBSome assembly in living cells and how this process is spatially regulated. Our data revealed that the BBSome formation is a sequential process. We show that the pre-BBSome is nucleated by BBS4 and assembled at pericentriolar satellites, followed by the translocation of the BBSome into the ciliary base mediated by BBS1.

                        The photoreceptor connecting cilium plays a leading role in these ciliopathy-related retinal dystrophies. Dysfunctional photoreceptor cilia cause the most severe type of retinal dystrophy: Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). The most common syndromic ciliopathies with an ocular manifestation are Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Usher syndrome.

                        Defects in ciliary structure and signaling result in a broad group of disorders collectively known as ciliopathies. One ciliopathy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), presents with diverse clinical features, many of which are attributed to defects in ciliary signaling during both embryonic development and postnatal life.

                        Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous multisystem disorder that causes severe visual impairment. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), hypogonadism, digit and renal anomalies, obesity, and a variable degree of mental retardation characterize the disorder.
