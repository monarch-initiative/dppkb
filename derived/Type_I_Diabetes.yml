name: Type I Diabetes
category: Metabolic
parents:
  - Autoimmune Disease
  - Diabetes Mellitus
prevalence:
  - population: Global
    percentage: 0.1-0.2
progression:
  - phase: Onset
    age_range: Childhood-Adolescence
pathophysiology:
  - name: Genetic Susceptibility
    description: Certain HLA gene variants (HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ8) and other susceptibility genes (INS) increase the risk of developing Type I Diabetes.
    genes:
      - HLA-DQ2
      - HLA-DQ8
      - INS
    downstream:
      - Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells
  - name: Environmental Triggers
    description: Viral infections or early dietary factors (cow's milk, gluten) may trigger the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals.
    triggers:
      - Viral Infections
      - Early Dietary Factors
    downstream:
      - Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells
  - name: Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells
    description: The immune system mistakenly targets and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
    cell_types:
      - Pancreatic Islet Beta Cell
    biological_processes:
      - T Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity
      - Autoantibody Production
    downstream:
      - Insulin Deficiency
  - name: Insulin Deficiency
    description: Loss of beta cells leads to a deficiency of insulin, a hormone required for glucose uptake.
    downstream:
      - Hyperglycemia
      - Impaired Glucose Utilization
      - Increased Lipolysis
  - name: Hyperglycemia
    description: Lack of insulin results in high blood glucose levels, as glucose cannot be efficiently taken up by cells.
    assays:
      - Elevated Blood Glucose
      - Elevated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
    downstream:
      - Glucosuria
      - Polyuria
      - Polydipsia
      - Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
  - name: Impaired Glucose Utilization
    description: Without insulin, cells are unable to utilize glucose for energy production, leading to cellular energy deficiency.
    downstream:
      - Weight Loss
      - Fatigue
  - name: Increased Lipolysis
    description: Insulin deficiency also leads to increased breakdown of fat (lipolysis) for energy, resulting in the production of ketones.
    downstream:
      - Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
  - name: Chronic Complications
    description: Persistent hyperglycemia over time can lead to damage in various tissues and organs.
    downstream:
      - Retinopathy
      - Neuropathy
      - Nephropathy
      - Cardiovascular Disease

    association: Susceptibility
  - name: INS
    association: Susceptibility
environmental:
  - name: Viral Infections
    notes: May trigger the autoimmune response in genetically susceptible individuals
  - name: Early Dietary Factors
    notes: Possible risk factors include early exposure to cow's milk and gluten
treatments:
  - name: Insulin Therapy
    description: Essential treatment to replace the missing insulin and regulate blood glucose levels.
  - name: Blood Glucose Monitoring
    description: Regular monitoring to manage glucose levels effectively.
  - name: Lifestyle Modifications
    description: Maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and adherence to treatment plans.
