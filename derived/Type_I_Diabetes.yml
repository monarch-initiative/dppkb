review_notes: Type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. The hallmark is hyperglycemia, which causes many acute symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, as well as long-term complications in multiple organ systems if blood sugars are not well-controlled. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious acute complication of insulin deficiency.
