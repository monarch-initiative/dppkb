    description: Characterized by significant changes in social behavior and conduct, with early emotional blunting and loss of insight.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:32440921
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD; 12/21) was the most common phenotype... bvFTD and PPA are the most common clinical phenotypes associated with PiD...
        explanation: The reference identifies that behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) is a common presentation of Pick's disease, implying that PiD can be characterized by bvFTD symptoms.
      - reference: PMID:21881831
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Some present with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)... predominantly apathetic with less florid social disinhibition and eating disturbances, and were more anxious than bvFTD(Pick's) patients.
        explanation: The study confirms that some patients with corticobasal degeneration (CBD) pathology showing bvFTD symptoms have similar trait overlaps with those having Pick's disease.

    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:32333004
        supports: REFUTE
        snippet: It can occur at any age, but most patients develop the disease between the age of 40 to 50 years.
        explanation: The onset of systemic sclerosis is mentioned to occur between the ages of 40-50, which suggests that many cases do not fall within the 40-65 range exclusively for progression.
      - reference: PMID:19415691
        supports: REFUTE
        snippet: Although age of onset varied significantly, the rate of progression appeared linear, independent of age of onset, and similar in all patients.
        explanation: The disease Niemann-Pick type C progression appears linear and independent of age of onset, suggesting that age between 40-65 is not particularly relevant for progression. This contradicts the statement's implication of age-specific progression.
      - reference: PMID:10908910
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Patients with disease onset between 40 and 59 years used a walker after 10.2 +/- 5.8 years, whereas those with disease onset between 60 and 79 years used a walker after 5.7 +/- 5.0 years.
        explanation: There is a clear distinction in disease progression based on age of onset, indicating that progression characteristics might indeed differ across specific age ranges.
pathophysiology:
  - name: Tauopathy
    description: Accumulation of tau proteins in the brain, leading to neuron damage and loss of brain function.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:20487487
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Pick's disease is a rare and incurable type of dementia that is associated with atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain over time as a result of accumulation of tau protein fibres known as Pick's bodies.
        explanation: The accumulation of tau proteins in the brain is mentioned as a central feature of Pick's disease, supporting the statement.
      - reference: PMID:26583316
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Pick disease tau neuropathology may originate in limbic/paralimbic cortices. The patterns of tau pathology observed here provide novel insights into the natural history and biology of tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
        explanation: This study outlines how tau pathology progresses and leads to neuron damage, supporting the statement's claim about the mechanism.
      - reference: PMID:30158706
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Using electron cryo-microscopy, we recently reported the structures of tau filaments from patients with Alzheimer's disease, which contain both 3R and 4R tau... Here we determine the structures of tau filaments from patients with Pick's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontotemporal dementia.
        explanation: The mechanistic understanding of tau filaments in Pick's disease supports the idea that tau protein accumulation leads to neuron damage and brain dysfunction.
      - reference: PMID:37351604
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: "Two siblings with deletion mutation Î”K281 in MAPT developed frontotemporal dementia. At autopsy, numerous inclusions of hyperphosphorylated 3R Tau were present in neurons and glial cells of neocortex and some subcortical regions."
        explanation: Genetic mutation leading to the accumulation of tau proteins and subsequent neuron damage supports the statement.
  - name: Neuroinflammation
    description: Chronic inflammation in the brain contributes to neuronal death.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:28394233
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: Recent studies have reported that neuronal populations expressing low levels of presenilin-1 (PS-1) display increased vulnerability in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether this phenomenon also occurs in other neurodegenerative diseases, we performed a quantitative immunocytochemical study of PS-1 distribution in the cerebral cortex of Pick's disease (PiD) cases and non-demented individuals.
        explanation: The provided literature discusses presenilin-1 expression in Pick's disease, but does not address chronic neuroinflammation.
      - reference: PMID:12870825
        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: Arnold Pick (1851-1924) provided the first description of the neurodegenerative disease associated with his name; but his importance to the field of neuroscience goes far beyond this eponymous gift. His view that the process of dementia should be seen as a mosaic of circumscribed neuropsychological deficits and not as a diffuse degradation of mental abilities is essential for progress in a cognitive neuropsychological approach to the study of dementias.
        explanation: This literature is historical and conceptual, focusing on Arnold Pick's contributions and perspectives on dementia, but does not mention chronic inflammation or neuroinflammation related to neuronal death in Pick Disease.

        snippet: Pick's disease is a type of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with circumscribed atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe.
        explanation: The literature states that Pick's disease involves atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe, which aligns with neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes as described.
      - reference: PMID:38521060
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Here, we report a high-resolution, comparative single-cell molecular atlas of the human primary motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and their transcriptional alterations in sporadic and familial ALS and FTLD.
        explanation: While discussing FTLD, which includes Pick Disease, literature supports degeneration in the frontal areas of the brain.
      - reference: PMID:11809165
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: The area of the substantia nigra was significantly reduced in PiD with PB... The pigmented and nonpigmented neuron counts in PiD with PB were not statistically different from those in controls.
        explanation: Although the literature specifies a reduction in neuron size rather than number, it aligns with the idea of neuronal degradation in PiD.
