        snippet: The anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody test was first established in 1983, using cardiolipin (negatively charged phospholipid) as an antigen in a solid-phase immunoassay. It was first applied to the study of systemic lupus erythematosus patients, and was found associated with thromboses and recurrent pregnancy losses. The wide use of this test was determinant in the definition of the 'aCL or antiphospholipid syndrome' (APS).
        explanation: The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

        snippet: Antiphospholipid antibodies are the hallmark of the antiphospholipid syndrome which is characterized by thrombosis. Human studies suggest that anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are elevated in patients having coronary artery disease compared with controls.
        explanation: The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies is a characteristic of antiphospholipid syndrome.

        snippet: Classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) require that antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) positivity is confirmed after at least 12 weeks. We tested the hypothesis that aPL at high titers remain positive while low titers fluctuate over time. [...] Anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta2 glycoprotein-1 antibodies (aB2GP1) were measured by chemiluminescence or ELiA fluorescence enzyme immunoassay.
        explanation: High titers of anticardiolipin antibodies are persistently positive in APS, confirming their association with the syndrome.

        snippet: Antiphospholipid syndrome includes elevation of either the lupus anticoagulant titer or the anticardiolipin antibody titer on two occasions, separated by 6 weeks in a patient with an episode of thrombosis.

        explanation: Although HLA-DR7 is not specifically mentioned, this study discusses HLA-DR associations and could support the association indirectly. However, the mention of HLA-DR7 is more explicitly connected to diabetic retinopathy rather than APS.

        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: A connection between cigarette smoking and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) was first reported in the late 1980s. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients with aPL are more likely to be smokers than those without aPL. These patients have a particularly high frequency of vascular events.
        explanation: The literature indicates there is some association between smoking and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, particularly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, it notes that the association has not been systematically examined and the connection is complicated by other factors. Therefore, it does not fully support a direct connection between smoking and antiphospholipid syndrome as an environmental factor.

Infection-induced aPL have been traditionally regarded as transient and were generally not associated with clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome.
        explanation: The statement is partially supported because while there is an association between infections and antiphospholipid antibodies, infection-induced aPL are traditionally regarded as transient and not generally associated with the clinical features of antiphospholipid syndrome.

        supports: NO_EVIDENCE
        snippet: The exact pathophysiologic mechanism in unclear but may be associated with an imbalance in the prostacyclin/ thromboxane ratio, which results in vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation.
        explanation: This reference discusses antiphospholipid syndrome in the context of pregnancy loss and does not provide evidence regarding infections as an environmental factor.
review_notes: Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thrombosis (both venous and arterial) and pregnancy complications due to autoantibodies against phospholipid-binding proteins. I expanded the thrombosis phenotypes to include both venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE) and arterial thrombosis (stroke/MI). I also added additional occasional phenotypes seen in APS like preeclampsia, livedo reticularis skin changes, and migraines. The pregnancy complications are a key feature so I increased their frequency to frequent.
