                        Lynch syndrome (LS) is a common cancer predisposition caused by an inactivating mutation in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Frequently a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), rather than an obviously pathogenic mutation, is identified in one of these genes. The inability to define pathogenicity of such variants precludes targeted healthcare.

Current research is continuously exploring potential heritable forms of bladder cancer.

          Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations in mismatch repair genes, leading to a very high lifetime risk of colorectal and endometrial cancers. Risks of other cancers like stomach, ovary, and urinary tract are also elevated. Screening and prophylactic surgery can reduce cancer incidence and mortality.
