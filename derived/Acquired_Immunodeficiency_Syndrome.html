                        In acquired immunodeficiency due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV itself rarely directly causes cancer; rather, it provides the immunologic background against which other viruses can escape immune control and induce tumors.

                        Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer, even as HIV-positive people live longer. Like other herpesviruses, human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) establishes a lifelong infection of the host that in association with HIV infection may develop at any time during the illness.

                        The subjects in this study are 24 women with AIDS who were treated by members of the Brown University medical faculty from June 1982 through June 1988... When zidovudine became available, it was administered to all remaining patients in the study. All subjects were counseled about HIV infection, its modes of transmission, and the early symptoms of opportunistic infections.

                        Although HIV antibody tests have been widely accepted in clinical diagnosis of HIV infection, they may not be sufficient to diagnose all subjects with HIV infection.

                        This reference explains that while HIV antibody tests are widely used, they are not always sufficient for diagnosing all cases, indicating a limitation.

                        HIV-1/HIV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, especially those based on env peptides or on the sandwich format, can be negative in HIV-1 subtype O infection.

                        The literature specifically points out that HIV antibody tests might not detect certain HIV subtypes, thus refuting the universal reliability of these tests for diagnosing AIDS.
