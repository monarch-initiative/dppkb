                        Phagocytosis refers to the process of internalization and degradation of particulate material... One microbe that is particularly successful at surviving within macrophages is the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can efficiently manipulate the macrophage at several levels, including modulation of the phagocytic pathway as well as interfering with a number of immune activation pathways that normally would lead to eradication of the internalized bacilli.

                        Post-TB lung dysfunction often goes unrecognised, despite its relatively high prevalence and its association with reduced quality of life. Host immune responses probably play a dominant role in lung damage, as excessive inflammation and elevated expression of lung matrix-degrading proteases are common during TB.

                It's important to note that resistance to isoniazid can develop through mutations in the katG gene, which reduces the activation of the drug, or in the inhA gene, which decreases the binding affinity of the activated drug to the InhA enzyme. To minimize the risk of resistance, isoniazid is typically used in combination with other antitubercular drugs, such as rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

                        Isoniazid is a prodrug that requires activation by the bacterial enzyme catalase-peroxidase (KatG). KatG couples the isonicotinic acyl with NADH to form an isonicotinic acyl-NADH complex.

                        In addition to inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, the isoniazid-NAD adduct can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) within the bacteria. These reactive species can cause damage to various bacterial components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, contributing to the bactericidal effect.

                        The arabinosyltransferases EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC are involved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall synthesis and are recognized as targets for the anti-tuberculosis drug ethambutol. These structures show how ethambutol inhibits arabinosyltransferases by binding to the same site as both substrates in EmbB and EmbC.

                        However, the sensitivity of sputum smear for acid-fast bacteria is only approximately 50% and sputum culture has a relatively long turnaround time.

                        While sputum culture is considered important for TB diagnosis, it has limitations such as long turnaround time which may affect its utility in confirming TB diagnosis promptly.

                        Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with detectable Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum is a major source of transmission.

                        Although this article acknowledges the importance of sputum smear for transmission evaluation, it also highlights that viable bacteria may still be present in some 'cured' patients, indicating a limitation in using sputum alone for confirming cure.

                        Poor-quality cough specimens (n=61) from presumptive tuberculosis cases were cultured and GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) successfully performed on samples transferred by flocked swab into PrimeStore molecular transport medium (PS-MTM). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was grown in culture from 13 (21.3 %).
