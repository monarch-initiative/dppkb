                        Monkeypox is a variola poxvirus that is related to smallpox, but monkeypox symptoms (fever, painful vesicular or pustular rash, and lymphadenopathy) are milder and fatalities are rare.

                        The abstract mentions that monkeypox symptoms are milder and fatalities are rare, which aligns with the statement that the West African Clade typically causes milder illness with lower mortality rates.

                        In addition to identified transmission mediators through animal-to-human and human-to-human, especially sexual transmission among men who have sex with men came to prominence in the 2022 global outbreak. Although the severity and prevalence of the disease differ depending on age and gender, some symptoms are commonly observed.

                        While the snippet predominantly discusses transmission and general symptomatology, the phrase 'the severity and prevalence of the disease differ' suggests variation among clades, implicitly supporting that the West African Clade, by comparison, is known for milder illness.
