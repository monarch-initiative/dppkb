No study had a stated aim regarding aging in hEDS/HSD, but all studies corroborated earlier natural history studies describing the age-related trajectory of manifestations in younger people. Studies found that symptom progression was heterogeneous, multisystemic, and unpredictable.

                        Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensibility, delayed wound healing, joint hypermobility, thin skin, easy bruising, tissue fragility, 'cigarette-paper' scarring over bony prominences, mitral valve prolapse, and other findings.
