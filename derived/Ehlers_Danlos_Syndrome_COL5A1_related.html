                        The classical form of the syndrome, which will be principally discussed in this review, can be due to mutations on collagen V, a fibrillar collagen present in small amounts in affected tissues.

                        Commonest GI symptoms were: abdominal pain (56.1%), nausea (42.3%), constipation (38.6%), heartburn (37.6%), and irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms (27.5%)... Among 37.8% of the 378 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the commonest abnormalities were gastritis, hiatal hernia and reflux esophagitis.

                        The study indicates that reflux esophagitis, which is related to gastroesophageal reflux, is one of the common abnormalities observed in EDS patients. However, it does not explicitly distinguish the frequency of this phenotype for COL5A1-related EDS specifically.

                        The reference suggests that minor physical trauma can cause severe injuries in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which implies an exacerbation of symptoms; however, it does not directly address COL5A1-related cases specifically.

                        While the article primarily discusses the genetic cause and molecular mechanisms, it indicates that the structural abnormalities in the extracellular matrix due to COL5A1 deficiency may contribute to symptom exacerbation following physical trauma. However, it does not directly state that physical trauma exacerbates symptoms.

                        The classic tragic facial expression was observed as well as chronic pruritus and mild hyperesthesia. Histology showed sparse, disorganized collagen and an increase in cutaneous mast cells.
