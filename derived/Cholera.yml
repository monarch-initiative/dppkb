        snippet: We also show that, in our model, effective reproduction numbers and epidemicity indices are explicitly related. Therefore, providing an upper bound to the effective reproduction number (significantly lower than the unit threshold) warrants negative epidemicity and, in turn, a rapidly fading outbreak preventing coalescence of sparse local sub-threshold flare-ups.

        snippet: The mainstay of therapy of cholera patients is rehydration with oral rehydration salt solution or intravenous Ringer's lactate depending upon the degree of dehydration.
        explanation: This reference affirms that ORS is a primary treatment method for cholera, consistent with the use of clean water, salt, and sugar to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.
  - name: Intravenous Rehydration
    description: Used for severe dehydration when rapid fluid replacement is necessary.

      - reference: PMID:8736618
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Patients with severe dehydration should be treated intravenously, as should those patients who do not tolerate oral rehydration solution (ORS).
        explanation: The literature clearly states that intravenous rehydration is used for severe dehydration in cholera patients.

        snippet: We compared the efficacy and safety of a single polyelectrolyte solution, Dhaka solution (DS), containing 133 mmol/L sodium, 13 mmol/L potassium, 98 mmol/L chloride, and 48 mmol/L acetate with and without 139 mmol/L (25 gm/L) dextrose in the rapid (4 hours) rehydration of 67 patients with diarrhea and moderate or severe dehydration requiring parenteral fluid therapy.
        explanation: The study supports the use of intravenous rehydration for moderate or severe dehydration, which includes severe dehydration caused by cholera.
      - reference: PMID:4885250

        snippet: N/A
        explanation: This study focuses on the measurement of dehydration in cholera and does not provide evidence specifically on the treatment involving intravenous rehydration.

        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Fluid therapy is the most important therapeutic measure in patients suffering from dehydration or hypovolemia owing to gastrointestinal diseases. The therapy should be tailored based on the patient's condition, physical examination, and diagnostic findings.
        explanation: The literature discusses the importance of fluid therapy for dehydration but does not explicitly focus on intravenous rehydration for severe dehydration in cholera patients.

        snippet: Severely dehydrated calves that are unable to suckle need intravenous fluids for effective resuscitation.
        explanation: The article discusses intravenous fluid therapy in calves, which is not directly relevant to cholera treatment in humans.
  - name: Antibiotics
    description: Shorten the course of the illness and reduce the severity, examples include doxycycline, azithromycin.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:24944120
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Overall, antimicrobial therapy shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea by about a day and a half compared to placebo or no treatment (MD -36.77 hours, 95% CI -43.51 to -30.03, 19 trials, 1013 participants, moderate quality evidence). Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50% (ROM 0.5, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.56, 18 trials, 1042 participants, moderate quality evidence) and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40% (ROM 0.60, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, 11 trials, 1201 participants, moderate quality evidence).
        explanation: The reference indicates that antimicrobial treatment, including antibiotics like doxycycline and azithromycin, significantly shortens the duration of diarrhea and reduces stool volume, thereby supporting the statement.
      - reference: PMID:11378428
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Antibiotics such as tetracycline and doxycycline shorten the duration of illness but do not significantly affect overall mortality.
        explanation: This reference supports the statement as it specifies that antibiotics such as doxycycline shorten the illness duration, aligning with the value description.
  - name: Zinc Supplementation
    description: Recommended for children to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:18184631
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Zinc supplementation significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea and stool output in children with cholera. Children with cholera should be supplemented with zinc to reduce its duration and severity.
        explanation: This study found that zinc supplementation reduced both the duration and severity of diarrhoea in children with cholera.
      - reference: PMID:17582575
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Short-course daily zinc supplementation shortens the duration (a 15%-24% reduction) and severity of the episode and is now recommended for the treatment of all episodes of diarrhea occurring among children <5 years of age.
        explanation: This reference supports the statement by recommending zinc supplementation to reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age.
      - reference: PMID:30269306
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Zinc supplements are recommended in children with acute infectious diarrhea.
        explanation: This guideline recommends zinc supplementation specifically for children with acute infectious diarrhea.
      - reference: PMID:37842003
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Zinc supplementation has previously been shown to improve resolution of symptoms from infectious diarrhea.
        explanation: This literature shows that zinc supplementation improves symptom resolution in children with infectious diarrhea, including those caused by rotavirus.
  - name: Vaccination
    description: Oral cholera vaccines can provide protection in endemic areas or during outbreaks.
    evidence:
      - reference: PMID:22634452
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: This vaccine should be used in areas where cholera is endemic, particularly in those at risk of outbreaks, in conjunction with other prevention and control strategies.
        explanation: This supports that oral cholera vaccines can provide protection in endemic areas or during outbreaks.
      - reference: PMID:15193408
        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: Retrospective analysis suggests that mass vaccination with oral cholera vaccines can be a useful adjunct tool for controlling outbreaks, particularly if implemented early in association with other standard control measures.
        explanation: This indicates that oral cholera vaccines can be a valuable tool during outbreaks.
      - reference: PMID:36255170
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Efficacies of the currently licensed cholera vaccines are not optimal in endemic settings and low in children below the age of five, a section of the population most susceptible to the disease.
        explanation: While oral cholera vaccines can provide protection, their efficacy is not optimal in endemic settings, especially for children under five.
      - reference: PMID:26494426
        supports: PARTIAL
        snippet: Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera-endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists.
        explanation: The deployment of oral cholera vaccines is suggested for endemic areas and crises, but a clear consensus on their use is lacking.
