        snippet: Malignant melanoma represents a neoplasm stemming from melanocytes or the cells that develop from melanocytes. Melanocytes, pigment-producing cells, arise from the neural crest and migrate to their final destinations in the skin, uveal tract, meninges, and mucosa. Most melanocytes are found at the epidermal-dermal junction of the skin, and the vast majority of melanocytes arise from cutaneous sites. Cancerous growths develop when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanning beds) triggers mutations (genetic defects) that lead the skin cells to multiply rapidly and form malignant tumours.
        explanation: While chemotherapy is an established approach for treating malignant melanoma, this reference does not provide explicit information about its use specifically in congenital melanocytic nevus-related melanoma.
notes: Early detection and treatment are critical for improving outcomes in melanoma arising in congenital melanocytic nevi.
