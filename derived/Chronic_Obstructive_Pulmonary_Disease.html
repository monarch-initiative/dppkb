                        Attempts to connect the products of the analysis of the EBC with the clinical manifestations of COPD such as dyspnea are scarce. Up to date research has shown a positive correlation between the elevated levels of some markers of EBC such as H(2)O(2) and 8-isoprostane and dyspnea, while others present ambiguous results.

                        Stopping smoking reduces the risk of developing COPD and is an essential treatment for this inflammatory disease. Smoking cessation decreases the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, number of hospitalizations, and decline in FEV1, as well as exacerbation frequency and overall mortality.

                        Mortality benefits to therapy have been demonstrated in only 2 therapeutic interventions to date: long-term use of daily supplemental oxygen and surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) for upper-lobe-predominant disease in patients with a low baseline exercise capacity.

                        The statement is supported as the literature suggests that lung volume reduction surgery is an established treatment for upper-lobe-predominant, severe emphysema in COPD patients.

          COPD is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible. Key respiratory symptoms include dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production, and wheezing. As the disease progresses, patients may develop signs of lung hyperinflation (barrel chest) and are at risk for respiratory failure. Systemic effects like fatigue and weight loss are also common, particularly in advanced disease.
