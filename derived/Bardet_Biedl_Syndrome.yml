        snippet: This study reports variants in BBS1 and BBS7 in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome from the Canadian Maritime provinces. The BBS1 variant NM_024649.5:c.1169T>G was identified as a recurrent variant in Prince Edward Island.
        explanation: This supports the claim that mutations in the BBS1 gene are a common subtype of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.

        supports: SUPPORT
        snippet: More than half of BBS patients carry mutations in one of eight genes encoding for subunits of a protein complex, the BBSome, which mediates trafficking of ciliary cargoes. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of the BBSome assembly in living cells and how this process is spatially regulated. Our data revealed that the BBSome formation is a sequential process. We show that the pre-BBSome is nucleated by BBS4 and assembled at pericentriolar satellites, followed by the translocation of the BBSome into the ciliary base mediated by BBS1.
        explanation: This explains the critical role of BBS1 in the assembly of the BBSome, further implicating it in Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
