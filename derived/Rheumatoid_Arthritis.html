                        The disease severity increases with increase in the age and reaches to its peak in above 60 years of age (p=0.001). The pattern of progression of RA in the Pakistani patients is almost consistent with other relevant studies conducted on European and European derived populations.

                        This study indicates that the progression of rheumatoid arthritis increases with age and is most severe in patients above 60. This indirectly supports the statement that progression can be observed in the age range of 30-60, by confirming its increase towards the upper end of this range.

                        Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic inflammation and synovial hyperplasia in the joints that ultimately lead to cartilage and bone destruction. A wealth of research has shown that CD4(+) T cells, especially IL-17 producing helper T (Th17) cells, play an important role in RA development.

                        Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with progressive articular damage. Activated cells of the synovium produce pro-inflammatory and matrix-degrading effector molecules, which maintain the inflammation and lead to the destruction of the involved joints. In addition to macrophages and T- and B-cells, fibroblast-like synoviocytes must be considered key cells in driving the pathological processes. They can be distinguished by their transformed-appearing phenotype and their invasion into adjacent cartilage and bone.

                        Synovial hyperplasia often presents when joints become inflamed due to immune cell infiltration. Synovial membrane... interact with synovial fibroblasts (SFs), T cells, B cells, and other inflammatory cells to promote the production of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-6, which are involved in the pathogenic process of inflammatory arthritis.

                        RA is thought to be associated with a conserved sequence of amino acids in a number of HLA-DRB1 alleles, called the RA shared epitope.

                        This suggests a genetic predisposition to more severe and chronic forms of RA, which could include symmetric polyarthritis, thus supporting the statement.

                        Methotrexate is presently the most popular of the DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and adenosine release and has a secondary effect on cytokines and polymorphonuclear chemotaxis. It is highly metabolised within cells and remains there for prolonged periods.

                        Glucocorticoids - be it conventional or modified/delayed-release formulations - have so far been convincing in clinical practice, and their widespread use will therefore continue.

However, it does not specify that they are used for short-term control of flares or as bridge therapy, thus only partially supporting the precise conditions mentioned in the statement.
