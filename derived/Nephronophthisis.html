                        Nephronophthisis is an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease and one of the most common genetic disorders causing end-stage renal disease in children. Nephronophthisis is a genetically heterogenous disorder with more than 25 identified genes. In 10%-20% of cases, there are additional features of a ciliopathy syndrome, such as retinal defects, liver fibrosis, skeletal abnormalities, and brain developmental disorders.

                        According to the official health statistics, Taiwan has the highest prevalence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the world. Each year, around 60,000 ESRD patients in Taiwan consume 6% of the national insurance budget for dialysis treatment. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been climbing during 2008-2012.

                        Nephronophthisis is a recessive disorder of the kidney that is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in children. Through positional cloning, many of the causative mutations have been mapped to genes involved in centrosome and cilia function.

                        Renal tubular disorders may affect multiple (e.g., Fanconi syndrome) or specific (e.g., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal glucosuria) tubular functions. Most conditions are primary and monogenic but occasionally are secondary to other disorders.

                        Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the strongest risk factors for hypertension, and hypertension can exacerbate the progression of CKD... therefore, one of the best strategies to slow the progression of CKD is to maintain the 'numbers' of these essential components necessary to preserve renal function. To this end, both the achievement of an optimal blood pressure and a maximum reduction in urinary protein excretion are essential.

                        This source suggests that managing blood pressure is essential in the context of CKD, which is related to nephron function. However, it does not explicitly mention Nephronophthisis, a specific type of nephropathy.

                        Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as above-goal elevated blood pressure (BP) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3 antihypertensive drug classes...evaluation includes identification of contributing lifestyle issues, detection of drugs interfering with antihypertensive medication effectiveness, screening for secondary hypertension, and assessment of target organ damage. Management of RH includes maximization of lifestyle interventions, use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics (chlorthalidone or indapamide), addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if BP remains elevated, stepwise addition of antihypertensive drugs with complementary mechanisms of action to lower BP.

          Nephronophthisis is a ciliopathy causing chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The cardinal feature is progressive renal failure, usually beginning in childhood and adolescence and leading to end-stage renal disease. Extrarenal manifestations like retinitis pigmentosa, liver fibrosis, and bone anomalies may also be seen, though less commonly than the renal phenotypes. Hypertension and other cardiovascular sequelae of renal failure are important associated features.
